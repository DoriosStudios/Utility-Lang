# Language Repository for UtilityCraft
This will be, from now on, the main database regarding the add-on's languages.

Actually, this repo is not supposed to be accessed by anyone other than Dorios Studios members.

- Perhaps in the future this repository will be useful for the community to bring translations made by themselves, saving devs time and bringing reach to the public. Until then, we should properly organize the main file and the 'main' languages.
